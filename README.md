<h1 align="center">Git Bartender</h1>
<p align="center">Providing Git shortcuts as well as a drinking problem and occasional yelling.</p>
<p align="center">
A Git CLI wrapper that provides shortcuts for useful Git commands you'd usually forget after searching.<br>
As long as something looks enough like a command, the bartender will <i>probably</i> get it right for you, so be as drunk as you'd like!

# ‚è±Ô∏è Future Plans

- Add `gb github actions Owner/Repo` (notice `Owner/Repo`)
- Make `gb help` show examples
- Auto-correcting arguments like branch names passed into `gb github pull-request`
- Add `gb continue` (to continue whatever operation you're stuck on)
- Add `gb list` (lists files based on predefined filters)
- Add `gb push` (pushes with attempts to fix when it fails)
- Add `gb pull` (pulls with attempts to fix when it fails)
- Add `gb add` (`git add` with staging certain ranges, but you type it all out instead of doing it in interactive staging)
